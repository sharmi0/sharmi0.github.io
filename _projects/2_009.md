    <b>The Product Engineering Process (2.009)</b> is one of the capstone classes for the Mechanical Engineering degree where students, in teams of approximately 15 students, take a product from conception to pre-production. The class begins with an intensive brainstorming process. We then down-select to present at a 6 ideas presentation. The product ideas are prototyped across the Sketch Model Review and Mockup deliverables. Finally, we select one final product and continue developing it through Most Critical Module Review and Technical Review. It all culminates in a final presentation on stage in MIT's Kresge auditorium.

    For this class, I worked with my team to develop and build a packable mannequin that collapses to fit in a carry on, enabling fashion designers to travel with a functional display for their pieces. Without this option, designers have to resort to pay to transport a display or pay to rent one on-site. The Green Team presents our product, Figure, at 33:13 in the video below, during which I demonstrate how our prototype folds down into a suitcase!

        <div class="caption">The rings are constructed from 1/4 inch aluminum, connected with kevlar string. The rings can be collapsed into a "block" of rings. When reassembling the mannequin, the rings can be pulled down and secured via a clamp to hold the rings in tension.</div>

        <div class="caption">The inner cover is made from jersey knit material and helps keep the set of rings connected. The outer cover is what gives the mannequin its look. It has 5 layers of material that allow it to be flexible enough to conform to the shape of rings, but sturdy enough to prevent the rings from showing on the exterior.</div>

        <img src="/assets/images/portfoliotiles/2_009tile.gif" alt="Mannequin Stand" style="width: 80%;">
        <div class="caption">The stand collapses down using a telescoping mechanism. The stand can be attached and removed from the inner bar of the rings via a push button locking mechanism. The profile of the stand and inner bar of the rings is such that it prevents rotational movements of the rings.
