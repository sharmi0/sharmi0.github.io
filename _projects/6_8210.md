      <b>Underactuated Robotics (6.8210) </b> is a class which explores the dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, where an underactuated system is defined as one where there are more degrees of freedom than control variables.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the final project, my teammate and I aimed to study the dynamics of a human rider performing a bike wheelie. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We represented the bike as two spherical wheels connected by a rigid rectangular frame, and the rider as a point mass at the end of an inverted pendulum attached to the frame’s center. The rear wheel was the driving wheel, actuated through a torque, while the front wheel was passive. The rider could also shift their center of mass, modeled as a torque on the pendulum, influencing the bike’s balance.
    </p>
    <p>
    We imposed constraints on the bike through different phases of the wheelie and used nonlinear trajectory optimization to solve for control inputs that could perform a stable wheelie. We found that for a wheelie to be achieved with the least effort from the rider, the input torque on the back wheel and torque applied by the hip (pendulum torque) should spike at first, then settle at some, typically zero, value.
