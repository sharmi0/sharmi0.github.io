    <b>Measurement and Instrumentation (2.671)</b> is a class which features a self-directed term-long project called Go-Forth-and-Measure, where every student has to define a question to answer, design an experiment, and measure and analyze the collected data to draw conclusions about the chosen question.

    For my project I chose to investigate how a single hydrophone can track ambient noise levels and motorboat traffic on a river. Specifically, I looked at whether the ambient noise levels would affect marine life and whether I could measure the speed and frequency of motorboat traffic by analyzing hydrophone time series data collected intermittently over a week. This project was inspired by the research I was doing at the time on PEARL - a sensorized floating autonomous platform. The poster and paper below highlight more details about the project.
