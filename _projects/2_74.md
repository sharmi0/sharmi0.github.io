      In <b>Bio-inspired Robotics (2.74)</b> students complete a project of their choosing with a team while integrating dynamics and control to test hypothesized design principles inspired by biology.
    </p>
    <p>
      My team and I built a hula hooping robot to understand how humans hula hoop. The two control parameters chosen were the hip angle and the hip angular rotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first developed a 2D MATLAB simulation in which the hip was represented as a point following a prescribed trajectory. We tested circular and spiral hip trajectories, motivated by the observation that we tend to extend our hips further when we begin hula hooping and once the hoop has built momentum, the amount of extension is minimal. Contact dynamics in the simulation were prescribed between the hula hoop and the hip point as a spring-damper. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We then built a physical system to test how the spiral and circular trajectories would affect the rise time, or the time it takes to reach steady state, of the hula hoop.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The hip angle was controlled by two linkages actuated by a servo, while the hip rotation was actuated by a motor at the base, spinning the linkages around a central axis. Using inverse kinematics and current control, the hip contact point could track either trajectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my work was on the CAD, assembly, and firmware for this project.
