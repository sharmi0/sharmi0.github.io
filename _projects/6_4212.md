      <b>Robotic Manipulation (6.4212)</b> introduces students to algorithmic approaches for creating robot systems that can autonomously manipulate physical objects in unstructured environments.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the final project, my classmate and I built a “shape replicating robot” with an integrated perception system in simulation. The perception system decomposed a given shape into unit blocks using a virtual camera. Then the arm and gripper were commanded to follow a series of linearly interpolated key frames for the end-effector to pick and place blocks in a configuration which matched the target shape.
