        <p><b>PEARL (Platform for Expanding AUV exploRation to Longer ranges)</b> is a concept for an autonomous floating servicing platform that can harvest solar energy to recharge autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and connect to new generation high-bandwidth low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations for near-real-time data transmission. You can read more about PEARL <a href="https://followpearl.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> .
    </p>
    <p>
    I worked on PEARL as an undergraduate researcher in the Engineering Systems Lab. I started off performing hydrodynamic analysis on PEARL for design verification. During the summer I worked on several projects as a full-time researcher on PEARL:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lead the PEARL team to rebuild and deploy PEARL A and manufacture, build, and deploy PEARL B.</li> 
      <li>Designed and built an autonomous anchoring module to enable PEARL to maintain position during missions.</li>
      <li>Designed and machined a custom maintenance platform to improve accessibility to PEARL’s electronics.</li>
      <li>Led testing and integration of a hydrophone system to capture acoustic data, and developed initial methods for signal analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During the subsequent fall semester I worked further on analyzing hydrophone data via a class called Measurement and Instrumentation (2.671).
    </p>
    <p>
    We also submitted this work to the MIT Mechanical Engineering De Florez Competition and won 2nd place!

Heave refers to the up and down movement of a structure in a fluid. The plate at the base of PEARL is used to reduce the heave motion by increasing the heave added mass, which increases stability.</div>

If RAO < 1, the body's motion is damped compared to the amplitude of the incoming wave. This plot shows that the body does not resonate in the heave direction at the frequencies that are prominent in the ocean (according to Pierson-Moskowitz).</div>
